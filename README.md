# vertx-vue-example

This is a minimal example application that uses VueJS on the front-end and Vert.x on the back-end.

API is exposed on paths starting with `/api` and contains only a single method, `/api/health`.
The back-end serves the front-end on all other paths.

The front-end consists of a single component that displays the health status of the back-end.

## Compilation and packaging

### Single JAR file

To compile both FE and BE to a single JAR file, execute:

```bash
mvn clean && \
npm run build && \
mvn compile assembly:single
```

or as an npm script:

```bash
npm run package:jar
```

This will:
 * remove all files from the `target` directory
 * build the front-end with `npm run build`
   * install the dependencies
   * build app with `vue-cli-service`
   * write result to `target` directory
 * compile back-end sources and package them together with front-end to a single JAR

### Local development

Repackaging the JAR file on every change would slow down the local development.
Both application may be ran separately to avoid this issue.

#### Back-End

The back-end application may be run with the following command:

```bash
mvn exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="jezorko.com.github.example.VertxVueApplicationKt"
```

By default, it will run on port `3000`.
Bear in mind the front-end will no be accessible through back-end if running this way.

#### Front-End

To only compile frond-end sources and run them in a development server, execute:

```bash
npm start
```

This will talk with the back-end running on localhost on port `3000` (default).
